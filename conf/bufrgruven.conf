#

#  ZIPIT
#
#     Setting ZIPIT to Yes or 1 will result in the final BUFKIT files being compressed
#     or zipped into ".buz" files, which can be read by the current version of BUFKIT.
#     Setting ZIPIT to anything else will get you the traditional BUFKIT ascii text
#     file, which also can be read by BUFKIT but is larger in size. 
#
#     Note that the ZIPIT setting below may be overridden on the command line by
#     passing the --[no]zipit flag. Enjoy!
#
ZIPIT = Yes


#  VERBOSE
#
#     Set VERBOSE to Yes if you want to follow along with the adventures of
#     bufr_gruven.pl as it searches out and processes BUFR files.
#
#     The VERBOSE setting below may be overridden with the --[no]verbose
#     command line option.
