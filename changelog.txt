 DATE - NEW RELEASE

    * Added support for the SREF monolithic tar files, which was done at the request of a user.
	  Warning - the tar files are large since they contain every station for a given member,
	  and you need to download every ensemble member, unless you just want the ensemble mean.
	  Additionally, processing all these data takes much longer than if you are requesting
	  the profiles from a few stations.
 
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
  
  12 May 2021 - The "Out with the NMM-B, in with FV3" Release

    * Added support for the hi-res window run of the FV3 (hrwfv3), which is replacing the 
	  NMM-B as of ... yesterday.   

    *  Decreased the DELAY parameter for the hi-res window ARW (hrwarw) BUFR files from 5 to 3 hours

    *  Decreased the DELAY parameter for the SREF and SREFMEAN BUFR files from 4 to 3 hours

	*  Removed the configuration files for the parallel runs from the conf/ directory.
	   The files are still available, just contact me.


  23 March 2021 - The "Change in Protocol" Release

    *  Change from HTTP to HTTPS as the protocol used when accessing the EMS family of
	   servers.  Previous Bgruven installations are probably failing as I write.

    *  Updated the GFS bufrinfo files to reflect the change in path on the NCEP 
	   servers.  

    *  Turned ON SREFMEAN bufr files for all NCEP servers, i.e., "--dset srefmean" 

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#

  30 December 2020 - The "This goes to 21!" Release

  *  Recompiled the routines used to create BUFKIT files with an updated version of
     the NCEP BUFR libraries. The old libs assumed a year ending in "21" or later 
     should be set to "1921" (or later), which seemed like a good idea when the
	 code was previously updated to avoid the Y2K crisis.

  *  Updated the ruc and hrrr bufrinfo.conf files to handle the increased forecast
     lengths (cycle dependent):

	 RAP:  Now a maximum of 52 forecast hours (03, 09, 15, and 21 UTC)
	 HRRR: Now a maximum of 49 forecast hours (00, 06, 12, and 18 UTC)

  *  Cleaned up the bufrinfo.conf files of redundant SERVER entries

  Many thanks to Bruce Hebbard of NCEP/NCO/SDB for letting me know which source files
  needed to be changed to correct the 2021 issue. 




#---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
  24 February 2020 - The New Station Lists+  Release

  *  Updated station lists for the gfs, hiresw, hrrr, nam, namnest, and rap BUFR datasets.

  *  Added the sref mean as a separate BUFR dataset, "--dset srefmean". The SREF mean is
     also (still) included as part of the SREF dataset, --dset sref.

  *  Finally corrected the STID for Dillon airport, MT (KLDN -> KDLN) in each station file.
     Thanks to Brett McDonald for annually bringing this issue to my attention.
     

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
  12 June 2019 - The FV3 Update release

  *  Added fix for VVEL introduced with the FV3GFS going operational on 12 June 2019

     No change is needed for users processing "GFS" data. Update allows for processing of
	 pre-FV3GFS version of the GFS BUFR files, which include OMEG, without any intervention 
	 by the user.

	 Just Bgruven!

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
  10 December 2018 - The HTTPS-VVEL-HRWAK Release - Final Take

   *  Implemented workaround for certificate requirement on NCEP servers. This requirement 
      may be in error and to be corrected soon, but a fix for the issue was added anyway.

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#

   8 December 2018 - The HTTPS-VVEL-HRWAK Release - Take Deux

   *  Recompiled namsnd on a Centos 6 system to be compatible with systems running
      GNU C Library release version 2.12 or later.
  
      The previous version of namsnd is included under gempak/bin/namsnd.rh5. If all
      else fails and updating your OS is not an option, you can rename namsnd.rh5 to
      namsnd, but you not have the OMEG values in the FV3 files (all 0's).
      

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
   7 December 2018 - The HTTPS-VVEL-HRWAK Release

   *  Added support for HTTPS downloads of BUFR files from the suite of NCEP servers

   *  Removed support for HTTP downloads of BUFR files from the suite of NCEP servers

   *  Modified and recompiled BUFR unpacking routines to support the vertical 
      velocity fields (VVEL) from the FV3 BUFR files. All other BUFR datasets contain
      OMEG, but this was not good enough for the FV3, nooo!  Now VVEL is converted
      to OMEG for viewing in BUFKIT.

      Note:  The VVEL->OMEG magic is not available when running a i686 system (32-bit)

   *  Changed the name of the "fv3gfs(x)" dataset to fv3(x) because nobody will get 
      confused except those who fail to read this guidance.

   *  Added support for the hires runs of the Alaska ARW & NMM, which required me to 
      place files sent to me by Jay Smith (Thanks Jay!) in the conf/ directory.

   *  Fixed a bug in the system curl call.

   *  Added routines to convert the curl/wget return code from a integer value to a
      description that you still will not understand.

   Special Note:  The GFS & FV3 BUFR files are hourly through hour 121, then 3-hourly
                  through hour 181.  The default is to unpack the first 121 hours
                  for BUFKIT. I believe that BUFKIT can now handle the irregular 
                  temporal frequency of the GFS & FV3 files (Thanks Ed!), so if you
                  want the whole kielbasa, change:

                    TIMSTN  = 121/2000   (Current default)
                  To
                    TIMSTN  = 141/2000   (Whole kielbasa)

                  In conf/fv3_bufrinfo.conf and gfs_bufrinfo.conf


#---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
  25 July 2018 - Still "Your HRRR Cup Runneth Over" Release

   *  Fixed the path on a remote server for the HRRR BUFR files

   *  Updated the available servers for all datasets

   *  Re-released yesterday's release.


  24 July 2018 - The "Your HRRR Cup Runneth Over" Release

   *  Added support for the upgraded HRRR & RAP BUFR datasets 

   *  Added support for the HRRR Alaska region dataset

   *  Updated the station tables for ALL BUFR datasets, which doesn't seem like it
      should take very long but always does.

   *  Tested Bgruven with the primary BUFR datasets to check whether they still 
      work as well as advertised.

   *  Changed advertising



#---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
 3 May 2018 - The "FV3 Fever" Release

   *  Added support for the parallel GFS, Aka, the FV3 global model. Also added the 
      broken out (individual) FV3 BUFR files to the EMS family of servers. The FV3 
      bufr files contain "Old School" 3-hourly profiles out to 180 hours.

      For use with BUFRgruven:

        %  bufr_gruven.pl --dset fv3gfsx --stations <station list> [other flags and stuff]

      Important: The FV3 BUFR files are experimental and posted to the servers 
                 between 9 and 12 hours AFTER a cycle time. This  means the 12 UTC
                 BUFR files will not be available until after 21 UTC at the earliest.

                 So be patient and you will be rewarded, eventually.

      


#---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
23 October 2017 - The "Unparallel(l*)ed" Release

   *  Added support for the parallel version of the RAP (rapx) & HRRR (hrrrx).

   *  Made individual BUFR files for the parallel version of the RAP & HRRR
      available on the family of STRC servers

   *  A few bug fixes so trivial it's not worth the trouble to describe.


   **Unparalleled  - American spelling
     Unparallelled - British spelling

     Aren't you glad you know.

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
22 June 2017  - The "22 June 2017" release

  * Fixed a significant bug affecting the download of BUFR file from external sources.
    When multiple instances of bufr_gruven.pl are running simultaneously, say processing
    gfs and hrrr BUFR files, they compete for use of the same temporary files, in which
    case a file may be deleted by one process while being read by another. This problem
    has been fixed by including the PID as part of the filename.

  **Extra special big thank you to Steve Zubrick for bring this problem to my
    attention and working with me patiently on the phone for hours while I resolved
    the issue.

  * Fixed a bug in Process.pm wherein the --noascii flag was not working. A thank you 
    goes out to Shane Searcy (ITO/DMX) for bring this problem to my attention.


  * Added support for the future "gfs" dataset (gfs_bufrinfo.conf) Note that 
    the location of the BUFR files on the remote servers may need to be changed.


#---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 
 Sometime early April 2017

  *  Added support for hourly GFSX fields through 120 hours.  Note that the BUFR files
     actually contain hourly data through 120 hours and then 3-hourly through 240 hours
     but Bgruven/BUFKIT currently supports only the hourly fields.

  *  Eliminated the "nam3km" & "nam4km"_bufrinfo.conf files in favor of a single "namnest" file.

  *  Re-Updated (it's a word now) the BUFR station lists from the  first update of the week
     since the files were found to be missing a few stations.

  *  Fixed a few minor directory name issues in the configuration files.

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
  January 2017

  *  Changed Station ID "KLDN" to "KDLN" in the station tables

  *  Now the logs/http_download.log file is deleted following a successful download

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
 13 January 2017 - "For the lack of an imagination" release

  * Added support for the parallel GFS BUFR files (gfsx) to Bgruven

  * Added support of the broken-out BUFR station files on the STRC family of servers

  * Updated ALL the station tables, whether it was needed or not

  * Added support for the "nam3km" BUFR dataset, which does not operationally exist yet. 
    Just think ahead now so I won't have to think later.

 
 15 December 2016

  * Added support for the new operational 3km NAM conus nest (nam3km), which had been mislabeled 
    namx4km during the parallel run period.

  * Updated nam and nam3km station files in support of operational change in January

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
  8 December 2016

  * Added support for the parallel 12km NAM and 4km NAM nest BUFR files to Bgruven

  * Added download of the parallel 12km NAM and 4km NAM nest BUFR files to the STRC family of servers

 
 28 August 2016 

  * Updated the location of the bufr files on the remote NCEP servers in the hrrr_bufrinfo.conf

  * Added the placeholder string "DDD" for Julian date in the _bufrinfo.conf files because
    "Julian date" sounds more sophisticated.


  8 July 2016 - The "Scientia ac Bgruven" Release 

  *  Added support for the HRRRx and RAPx BUFR files, just because I was asked nicely and 
     needed a sense of accomplishment in my life.  I feel better now.

  *  Added the individual HRRRx and RAPx BUFR files to the STRC family of servers. The 
     NOMADS Parallel server only has the monolithic versions of these data sets. You 
     can thank me later.

  *  Update guidance and corrected a spelling error in the _bufrinfo.conf files.

  *  Added NOMADSP = para.nomads.ncep.noaa.gov to the bufrgruven.conf file

  *  Fixed a benign bug when downloading the monolithic "*.tar.gz"  files they were
     incorrectly named on the local system.  Just keep'n things tidy around the
     "Double Bgruven" ranch.


26 October 2015 - The "Cogito, ergo Bgruven" release

  *  Updated the SREF configuration which includes changes to the sref_bufrinfo.conf, 
     sref_stations.txt, and BUFR packing files. Note that the "descriptor" part of the 
     sref MEMBER-KEYS in sref_bufrinfo.conf is likely to be incorrect as I could not
     locate updated information during my exhaustive 15 minute on-line search.
     I'll update once the information falls into my lap.

28 September 2015

  *  Updated the hrwnmm and hrwarw configuration files to reflect changes in the monolithic 
     bufr file names on the NCEP servers. Then I fixed it again, and again until it was right.

11 August 2015

  *  Updated the operational BUFR station lists for the nam, nam4km, aknest (nam), hinest (nam), 
     gfs, rap, hrrr, sref, hrwarw and hrwnmm (nmb) data sets.

  *  Updated all the <data set>_bufrinfo.conf files to include the NOMADS data servers. The 
     NCEP FTP and HTTP servers are still listed in the files but are commented out.  You 
     may still use them until they go bye, bye.

  *  Removed support for the STRC server (which still exists) but replaced it with support
     for the EMS1, EMS2, and EMS3 servers.  The EMS "family of servers" are the new STRC
     data servers, which may be found at:

     http://ems[1|2|3].comet.ucar.edu/data

  *  Tested every dataset/server combination, just because I care

  *  Reverse the date order of information in the changelog.txt file, just so you don't
     have to scroll down to the bottom to read this message again.


31 January 2015

  *  Updated GFS station list per 14 January GFS update
  *  Added the soostrc site to the list of HRRR BUFR data servers.


06 November 2014 -

  * Replaced 32-bit GEMPAK binaries with 64-bit versions, which I though was done a long time ago

  * Fixed multiple bugs introduced with Perl 5.14|15|16..


30 September 2014 - The "Hrrray!!" Release

  * Added support for the following BUFR data sets:

     a. 3km operational HRRR - "--dset hrrr"
     b. 4km NAM Hi-Res Alaska next  - "--dset aknest"
     c. 4km Hi-Res ARW   (conusarw;  monolithic files only) - "--dset hrwarw --monolithic"
     d. 4km Hi-Res NMM-B (conusnmmb; monolithic files only) - "--dset hrwnmm --monolithic"

  * Update BUFR station tables for all data sets

  * Added "--[no]pack" flag - [Do not] Compress the BUFKIT files to create "*.buz" data - same as --[no]zipit'

  * Made minor changes to each of the <dset>_bufrinfo.conf files


31 July 2013 - The "Road Trip!!" Release

  Fixed a problem wherein previously downloaded SREF BUFR files would be reprocessed even
  when missing members could not be downloaded. So if you were missing members, and who
  isn't, but a download attempt failed to acquire any of your BUFR buddies, BUFRgruven would
  still process files that had been previously downloaded and processed, which just ain't right.
